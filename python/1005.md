# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, Julius"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0

J
```
- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, Julius!"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0

o
```
- Looping Through a String

``` python
for x in "Julius":
  print(x)
  
  J
  u
  l
  i
  s
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Hello, Julius!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))

14
```

QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"

``` python
a = "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 33 = 31 letter 2 space

33
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False
``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
# print("free" in txt) == > True
# print("HDJSAdhj" in txt) == > True
print("HJSAdh" in txt)  # False

False
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HDJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HDJSAdhj' is present.")
  
  Yes, 'HDJSAdhj' is present.
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HJSAdhj' is present.")
  
```
- Negative Indexing
``` python
b = "Hello, Julius!"
print(b[-5:-2])
# -2 not included

liu
```
- Python - Modify Strings
- The `upper()` method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case
``` python
b = "Hello, Julius!"
print(b.upper())

HELLO, JULIUS
```
- Remove Whitespace with `strip()` method
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end
``` python
b = " Hello, Julius! "
print(b.strip())

Hello, Julius
```
- The `replace()`method replaces a string with another string
- `seperator`
``` python
b = " Hello, Julius! "
print(b.replace("o", "w"))

Hellw, Julius!
```

```python
b = " Hello, Julius! "
print(b.split(","))

[' Hello', ' Julius! ']
```

```python
b = " Hello, Julius! "
print(b.split("D"))

[' Hello, Julius! ']
```

- String Concatenation:To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the `+` operator.
```python
a = "Hello"
b = " , "
c = "Julius"
d = a + b + c
print(d)

Hello , Julius
```

- Python - Format - Strings
```python
age = 18
txt = "My name is Julius, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))

My name is Julius, and I am 18
```


```python
quantity = 10
itemno = 24
price = 99.99
myorder = "I want {0} pieces of item {1} for {2} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

I want 10 pieces of item 24 for 99.99 dollars.
```
- String Methods

```python
txt = "hello, you look good."

x = txt.capitalize()

print (x)

Hello, you look good.
```


```python
txt = "Hello, My Name is Julius Erick!"

x = txt.casefold()

print(x)

hello, my name is julius erick!
```
